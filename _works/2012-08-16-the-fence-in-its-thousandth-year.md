The Fence In Its Thousandth Year

Written by Howard Barker

Directed by Bob Pavlich

As part of the Northcote Town Hall 2012 season

The Fence is a violent, comic, sexually provocative epic about scandal in a ruling monarchy and its subsequent fall from power.

Set in a world of rising frontiers and illegal immigration, the fence of the title is both a physical barrier between peoples and also a metaphor for the forbidden with all its transgressive attraction.

Written by one of Englandâ€™s most provocative dramatists, The Fence makes a thought-provoking contribution to the debates surrounding one of the great social crises of our times.
