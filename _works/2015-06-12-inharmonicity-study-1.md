It began as an ongoing study into physical objects and their imperfections when they produce sound. However, naturally as a part of the process of exploration, I did not entirely adhere to that brief and the piece has expanded into exploring frontier between synthetic sounding sounds and natural sounding sounds as well as indeterminate processes.

This particular version is was built in Supercollider, which allowed me to create procedure-based, dynamic signal flows using standard programming control structures. This granted me a great deal of flexibility when it came to exploring the emergent complexities that arise from physical sound sources, which are the result of many events happening at once inside an object.

This study was initially based on the sound of gongs from the Gamelan tradition, both struck and bowed. The first version was all one texture and was actually written to help put my two year old niece to sleep. The piece is never the same in terms of its micro structures, yet the character of gesture is very clearly defined by specific parameters that determine durational ranges, frequency ranges, levels of inharmonicity between partials, spatialisation, volume and envelope.
