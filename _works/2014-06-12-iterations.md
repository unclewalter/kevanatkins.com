teaser: "The piece explores the idea of recursion by taking a recording of a sound, performing with it, recording that performance in the space and then performing with that recording. At the centre of the piece is a MaxMSP patch which takes the sound, chops it into smaller slices that can be played back individually and treats them with formant filters. Those slices can in-turn be chopped and manipulated as well. All of these actions are performed according to directions given by the performance score."

The piece explores the idea of recursion by taking a recording of a sound, performing with it, recording that performance in the space and then performing with that recording. At the centre of the piece is a MaxMSP patch which takes the sound, chops it into smaller slices that can be played back individually and treats them with formant filters. Those slices can in-turn be chopped and manipulated as well. All of these actions are performed according to directions given by the performance score. 

This concept has itself gone through many iterations, although the patch has not changed that much. Inspired by Alvin Lucier’s work, *I’m Sitting in a Room* (1969), this piece expands on the idea of using recursive processes to transform a sound by obscuring the original sound more aggressively and quickly with alterations to rhythm, duration, pitch and the use of the filters. The duration of the piece can be anywhere between a minute and however long the performer desires. As each iteration of the piece comes around, the sound is completely transformed as the new sound being manipulated is extracted from the performance of the previous sound.
