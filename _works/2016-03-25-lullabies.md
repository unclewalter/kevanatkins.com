**Duration:** 2h49'53"

Lullabies is a series fixed media works that I am releasing as an album. The project started from a generative ambient works which I put together to help myself get to sleep. This series of works explores my insomnia through different lenses. Initially the music served as a treatment, but then it grew into a reflection on the experience of insomnia and the kinds of things that would keep me awake.

Released June 2016.

### Program notes

**Geneva**

I was going through my various field recordings that I'd collected over the past two years and I found a bunch from my trip to Geneva which brought back a lot of memories. So I thought I'd do a piece reflecting that time. Not all the samples are from that trip, in fact mostly not. This is more a reflection rather than a documentation of the trip through sound. I felt very welcome there and I was lucky enough to be put up in a composer friend's apartment for the weekend.  Amongst the knick knacks in the apartment were many scores and instruments. In the mornings I spent a lot of time on the harpsichord that he had in there to start the day, I'd roam around, go to concerts, meet people and end the day with a night out at Cave 12.

Source samples:

- A fire pit
- Harpischord plucked behind the bridge.
- Birds
- Various outdoor atmos.
- A siren going off in the Paris Métro

**FFT Grain Meditation**

A looping granular texture generated from a small sample from a recorded improvisation. As the piece progresses the pitch is modulated very slowly with an increasing amplitude using a FFT-based pitch shift. Although the pitch material is the same relatively, the shifts across a four octave range effectively emphasize different pitches in the loop depending non-linearities in sound reproduction and perception.

Source sample:

- A single, struck singing bowl note

**Awake in the Other Room**

A nod to Brian Eno's work in the late 70s, early 80s. The piece is a 25% speed version version of one of my piano improvisations, which has been stretched, compressed, pitch-shifted and resampled multiple times. I originally had it stretched out to over 4 hours. Finally I compressed it back to 30 minutes and used spectral treatments and distortion to shape it into a piece.

**Band-Pass Love Poem**

Band-pass Love Poem is a sound work that traces the evolution of the subject’s
awareness amongst the chaos of an unforgiving and indifferent universe. As the
conscious subjects evolve they fall in love with their surroundings. They find
the hidden songs embedded in the what is fundamentally cosmic noise.

Over its two hour duration, the dense, chaotic texture of the wave-shaping and
distortion treatments on a set of low sine tones is gradually transformed as though
the narrow of a band-pass filter to isolate the high-order overtones of the sound,
revealing the hidden melodies that are otherwise masked psycho-acoustically.
