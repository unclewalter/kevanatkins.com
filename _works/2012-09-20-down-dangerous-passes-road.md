Written by Michel Marc Bouchard

Directed by Sean Scanlon

Assistant Director: Libbee King

Three estranged brothers are brought together by tragedy. What happened to their father fifteen years ago, and why does it plague the siblings still? A look at the cruelness, brutality and tenderness that we're capable of.
