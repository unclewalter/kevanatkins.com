I was in the hospital recently for 3 days while taking a part in medical research. Every corner of the place was filled with the cold white fluorescent light and all the features were stark and plain. I remember everything in my visual field demanding an equal amount of attention or apathy. I remember it putting my into this heightened state of unrelenting awareness, sometimes bordering on edginess while simultaneously feeling incredibly tired.

When I came in, it seemed to be just the right combination tiredness and nervousness to make me hyper productive. I would pass the time do lots of live coding and processing on my laptop while I was being tested. I remember manipulating the sounds of the hospital and laughing as I twisted the voice of the nurse telling me I need to lie flat to take my vitals and blood. I pulled it all together in one big session and in about 4 hours, I had this all chopped up, mixed and mastered.
