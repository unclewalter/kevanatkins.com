I had a blocked nose and it felt like my brain was trying to escape. So I tried to push it back in with sound. Then it kind of grew in to a work.

There's not much to this one. Most of the sound comes from the resonant filters ran through various forms of granular processing. I also played with a bit of ambisonic binaural encoding to make it feel like some of the sounds were flying past the head. I use two sound sources to excite the filters and that's pretty much all there is to it.

**Original sources:**

- Playing around with a contact mic by itself.
- Some low register noodling on the Rhodes Mk I.
