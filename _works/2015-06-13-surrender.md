In the most intimate recesses of the mind, desires, impulses and fears stir and unsettle. They can collectively propel us forward with ambition or they pull us inward to find comfort. At their extremes, they can be positively transformative but they can also be devastatingly destructive. Part 1 of the trilogy, Body Turned Traitor explores this latter extreme through the eyes of a young woman battling severe depression.

Desperate for help, she is prescribed stronger medication, but it only makes it worse. In the sound world of this work, the strings groan and fluctuate rapidly between pitches and timbres, often unintentionally, as her body revolts. The image is distorted further as she struggles to hold onto the last thread of reality, sounds come and go, superimpose on one another and become alien as they are stretched and compressed. The others become disembodied. Even the most re-assuring voices become static emanating from a plastic box. The work reflects the internal dissonance as the cello is pitted against the live looping and the Dictaphone.

Every sound aside from the voices recorded on the Dictaphone is produced either live or as a manipulation of live material that has been recorded earlier in the performance. Beyond playback speed and volume, no other parameters are manipulated.
