Directed by Poppy Rowley

Jude has always known she doesn’t want kids. Her sister Susie is unsure if her ovaries are twinging or if she just needs to wee.

One day, in a café full of ‘yummy mummies’, Jude loses the plot and kicks a pram. Then gets arrested. Then gets sent to anger management.

This witty and touching play premiered at the Brighton Fringe Festival, before a critically acclaimed run at the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe in 2015.

“I am the Édith f**king Piaf of the empty womb. Je ne regrettay f**king rien”.
