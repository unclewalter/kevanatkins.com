Adaptation by Edward Einhorn

Music by Henry Akona

Student Theatre and Film's artistic director, Bob Pavlich, directs Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? This New York adaptation of the novel by Phillip K. Dick is the basis for the film Blade Runner.

Most people emigrate to Mars - unless they have a job to do on Earth. Like Rick Deckard - android killer for the police and owner of an electric sheep. He has to find, identify, and kill six androids which have escaped from Mars. They're machines, but they look and sound and think like humans - clever, dangerous humans.

This adaptation has previously only been performed once before. This production by the Untitled Theater Company #61 in New York in 2010 played to sell-out crowds and garnered considerable press interest.
