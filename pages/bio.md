Kevan Atkins is a composer, sound artist, and engineer. His practice has grown out of an interest in the intersections between technology, stories, ideas, materials, and process, realised through diverse collaborations, new works and supporting work within the community.

Drawing on his theatrical background, his concert works are often centred around physicality and space, often leveraging the deformation of bodies and instruments, such as in _Legionnaire_ (2014) for solo contrabass. His fixed-media works have been presented in across a variety of mediums including radio broadcast, digital distribution and installations, including the two-hour work, _Band-Pass Love Poem_ presented at the artist-run festival, _Love/City III: The PLANETARY_ in 2016. These works frequently draw on his software development and electronics background involving bespoke software and hardware.

Kevan carries this practice into his collaborations with a diverse range of performers and composers, drawing on his background to help them realise often unusual ideas that might be difficult or impossible with conventional, off-the-shelf means. His work within the music community also includes live concert recording, web development, building installations, teaching, curation, and organising events, including his work as production manager for the festival and academy _Tilde New Music and Sound Art_, in which he has been able to engage with many of his interests.
