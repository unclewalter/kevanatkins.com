Kevan Atkins (1992, Melbourne, Australia) is a composer, sound artist and
audio engineer who works in a variety of media. By focusing on techniques and
materials, Atkins considers composing a craft which is executed using clear formal rules and which should always refer to social reality. His works demonstrate how life extends beyond its own subjective limits. It challenges the binaries we continually reconstruct between Subject and Other, between our own ‘cannibal’ and ‘civilized’ selves.

His works are given improper functions: significations are inversed and form and content merge. Shapes are dissociated from their original meaning, by which the system in which they normally function is exposed. Initially unambiguous meanings are shattered and disseminate endlessly.
