title:  "Nine Rehearsals - Week 2"
teaser: "Only two weeks in things are moving so quickly already. With only one
rehearsal this week, I'm surprised we covered as much ground as we did.
We blocked half of the second act and found ourselves running through to
the end of the play with some improvised blocking anyway. Though this
week is really the calm before the great storm that will be next week as
we have to present for showings, get new photos done, really nail the
second act and then tie the whole thing together. It's crazy, feels like
the whole process has just started but is also nearing the end as well. "
