title:  "Nine Rehearsals - Week 1"
teaser: "The first of the really exciting projects I'm working on this year is a play called 'Nine' by Jane Shepard directed by May Parley. A two hander originally written for two women which explores the human will to live through it's two characters, in this case being a man (portrayed by me and a woman (Asleen Mauthoor). We're performing this in a really cool space; the storage room in Union Hall at La Trobe University. It's a fantastic space when embraced for what it is. On Thursday, we had a meeting with Tom Willis, the lighting designer who alongside May had some really strong concepts to underpin the design of the show and was generally quite positive about the direction we were going in."

The first of the really exciting projects I'm working on this year is a
play called "Nine" by Jane Shepard directed by [May
Parley](http://www.starnow.com.au/maylynnparley "http://www.starnow.com.au/maylynnparley").
A two-hander originally written for two women which explores the human
will to live through it's two characters, in this case being a man
(portrayed by me) and a woman ([Asleen
Mauthoor](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5619395/ "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5619395/")).
We're performing this in a really cool space; the storage room in Union
Hall at La Trobe University. It's a fantastic space when embraced for
what it is. On Thursday, we had a meeting with [Tom
Willis](http://www.brightsparklighting.com.au/ "http://www.brightsparklighting.com.au/"),
the lighting designer who alongside May had some really strong (yet
simple) concepts to underpin the design of the show and was generally
quite positive about the direction we were going in.

In the scheme of plays I have performed in this is probably the most
involved part I have ever played and yet it has the least rehearsals
with only six to eight rehearsals (excluding tech/dress) before opening
so naturally I've really had to really do my homework on this one. Going
into the first rehearsal definitely made me nervous. Having learnt 117
lines (with another 100 or so to learn still) without Asleen, it was
hard to know if I had developed any habits that would jar against her
pacing and delivery. Nonetheless, things thus far have been going
smoothly and after a (admittedly stumbling) line run things smoothed out
really quickly, we managed to rehearse off-book without too many issues
and completely block the first half of the show. Taking it to the floor
always makes a difference and here even two rehearsals in it has already
started to lift off find its energy, which is great.

I hope the next week of rehearsals will be equally as fruitful. I'm
really excited for this one.
