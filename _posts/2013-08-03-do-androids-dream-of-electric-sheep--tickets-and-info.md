Adaptation by Edward Einhorn \
Music by Henry Akona \
Student Theatre and Film’s artistic director, Bob Pavlich, directs Do
Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? This New York adaptation of the novel
by Phillip K. Dick is the basis for the film Blade Runner and promises
to enthral audiences.  \
\
Most people emigrate to Mars - unless they have a job to do on Earth.
Like Rick Deckard - android killer for the police and owner of an
electric sheep. He has to find, identify, and kill six androids which
have escaped from M ars. They’re machines, but they look and sound and
think like humans - clever, dangerous humans. \
\
This adaptation has previously only been performed once before. This
production by the Untitled Theater Company \#61 in New York in 2010
played to sell-out crowds and garnered considerable press interest. \
