So, this is the _new site_. This time I'm eschewing the whole CMS-based design. It was more trouble than it was worth and had a lot of faults. All of the cogs that had to turn every time the site need to render a page just caused problems. The backend was really clunk and so it was left very out-of-date (as you can probably see from the very crusty old content that was migrated across), so I have moved over to a static page using Jekyll. That means I no longer have to worry about crap like webservers and whether my Rails app is actually running properly. As it is right now, it's still a bit of a building site and there are some unpopulated sections, however this should hopefully be sorted in the next couple of weeks. 

At the very least, I can at least provide updates on the various goings on, including a few exciting announcements which I will fill you in on soon. In the mean time, you can check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/unclewalter) as I sometimes post the odd bit on there.
