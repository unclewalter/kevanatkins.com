***Presented by Centre for Theatre and Performance***

Written by Peter Houghton\
\
Directed by Anne Browning\
*Bachelor of Performing Arts: Second Year Production*

A city teeters on the verge of anarchy. Inside, authorities attempt to
tighten their control against the threat of foreign invasion. Outside, a
motley group of criminals and dissidents wait for a trial that never
comes – but of what are they guilty? If these outcasts can infiltrate
the city walls, they can destroy the record of their crimes and perhaps,
begin again. A comedy about legacy, guilt and honour in a world on the
edge of darkness, *The Gate* reunites an award-winning writer-director
team for the premiere of a new Australian play.

Anne Browning has directed several shows for MTC, Malthouse Theatre and
Red Stitch, including the 2012 tour of Melissa Bubnic‘s *Stop.
Rewind.* In 2013, she will direct Dorothy Hewett’s *Man from
Mukinupin*for La Trobe University and *A Guide to Unhappiness* by Sunny
Leunig and Jono Burns for the Adelaide Cabaret Festival.
