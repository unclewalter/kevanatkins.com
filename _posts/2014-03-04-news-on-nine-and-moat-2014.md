So today I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
Moat Festival 2014 commences this week starting tomorrow kicking off an
exciting two week theatre festival season at La Trobe University which
includes a variety of really exciting shows and even an art exhibition
which is a new addition this year.

And now to the bad news, I'm very sorry to announce that Nine will no
longer be included as part of Moat Festival due to unforeseen
circumstances which led to some complications (that I won't get into
here) which made staging this production far more difficult that it
needed to be and so we were forced to withdraw our production. However,
we do hope to still put this show on for you in future. So we are
putting this whole project on ice and looking into our options in the
future. Hopefully we (May, Asleen and myself) can viably stage this show
independently either later this year or early next year.Â 

If you still wish to see some show in this year's Moat Festival season,
check it out the under events section on the [La Trobe Student
Union](http://unione.latrobesu.org.au/Common/ContentWM.aspx?CID=93 "http://unione.latrobesu.org.au/Common/ContentWM.aspx?CID=93")
